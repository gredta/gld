                    I would recommend to everyone as a plumbing company. I had tried a couple different plumbing companies , GLD plumbing was more fair on the prices.The job was done very well and everything was left clean and neat. Great service.                </p>

                    I highly recommend this company! I had a plumbing emergency and had to turn off all the water to my house. GLD's repairmen were at my home within two hours of me calling on a Saturday. The techs were highly skilled and professional! I'm grateful that they could help us!!

                    I had major bathtub issues with drainage and water pressure. They found both problems. We arranged an appointment and they did a wonderful job! Everything looks and is working brand new. I am very satisfied with the work done. They were very professional, knowledgeable and easy to work with and very affordable. Guys job well done! I highly recommend GLD Plumbing. Thank you again for a fantastic job!!! I will definitely call this company again if needed. Keep up the amazing workâ€¦                </p>

                    Great work done at a fair price.  They came out when we needed them, got the work done well, and we had all 3 of our projects done for less than we paid one of the chain places to visit us the last time we needed plumbing help. I can't recommend GLD enough!

                    Just had EXCELLENT experience with GLD. Came when they said, took care of toilet leak, charged what they said. Cleaned up. Friendly,polite and efficient. Would use them again any time.                </p>

                    Would definitely recommend them, I had an emergency leak in my kitchen, they showed up within an hour, very professional. They also fixed it the right way and took no shortcuts.                </p>
